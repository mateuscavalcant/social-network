# social-network
## Social network project developed with Go, MySQL and React.

I began this project while studying relationships between tables in structured databases. I built a database in MySQL Workbench with the initial intention of it being a simple table structure for a social network. However, I decided to expand the project by adding a server.

I chose the Go language to build the server because I was already familiar with it and knew it offered good performance in creating APIs. Specifically, I utilized the Gin framework in Go for its efficiency and ease of use in handling HTTP requests. During the project's development, I was able to grasp the practical concept of scalability provided by the Golang. As the application grew and new features were added, the server maintained its stable performance.
